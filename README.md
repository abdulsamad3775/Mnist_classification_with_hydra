# MNIST Classification Project

## Overview
This project is a simple example of image classification using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a Resnset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Hydra
- 
## Usage
1. Training and Evaluation:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   Additional configurations can be set using Hydra, such as batch size, learning rate, etc.
2. tensorboard
   tensorboard--logdir=tb_logs
